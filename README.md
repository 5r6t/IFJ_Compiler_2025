## To-Do

- [ ] choose assignment variant:
    - Assignment variant with the implementation of the symbol table using a table with scattered items with implicit chaining of items (TRP with open addressing)
    - AST variant - assignment with the implementation of the symbol table as a height-balanced binary search tree
- [ ] go through the assignment together
- [ ] try out the functionality of git etc. (e.g. everyone adds a few constants for error messages, see assignment page?)
